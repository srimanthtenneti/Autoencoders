1. Linear Autoencoders

## Autoencoders
These are very useful models that consist of an encocder and a decoder block. The main applications of autoencoders are image compression and decompression, image de-noising, etc.

## Model Architecture

* The basic architecture of a Autoencoder is described by the diagram above. 

* In this notebook we are using the MNIST dataset to compress the 28x28 images and decompress them back to the original image. The architecture of the model used in this project is described below.
